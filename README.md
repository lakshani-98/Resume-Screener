# Resume Screener

This project is a Resume Screening Agent built using LangGraph and OpenAI to automate the evaluation of resumes against job requirements. It follows a structured workflow with two key nodes:

1. Analyze Resume – This node processes the resume content and compares it with the given job requirements using OpenAI. It extracts relevant skills, experience, and qualifications to generate an analysis.
2. Classify Resume – Based on the analysis, this node categorizes the candidate into predefined classifications (e.g., Strong Match, Needs Improvement, or Not Suitable).
   
The workflow ensures a systematic and automated approach to screening resumes, improving efficiency in the hiring process.
